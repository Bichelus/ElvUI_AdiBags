    Various bug fixes for Dragonflight (#759)
    
    This CL fixes the addon not loading for users and eliminates most errors so the Addon is usable. This CL does not add new features or support for the new bag type in Retail, yet. A set of more comprehensive updates will be released at a later date.
    
    * Fixed a nil value bug in ItemLevel.lua
    
    * Updated docmeta
    
    * Fixed bug that caused item borders not to update.
    
    * Updated config TOC

    Resolve issues with new container APIs (#788)
    
    * Resolve issues with container apis
    
    The container APIs on 10.0.2 have moved into C_Container and a few functions
    have been outright removed.
    
    In addition the returns for GetContainerItemInfo and GetContainerItemQuestInfo
    have changed to use tables instead of a long list of returns.
    
    This introduces a set of wrapper functions to handle working with both the
    new C_Container APIs and the legacy APIs to support wrath and classic-era.
    
    * Only activate for GameTooltip
    
    The new AddTooltipPostCall would be called for other tooltips as well,
    so maintain the existing behaviour by verifying we have the correct frame.
    
    * Update TOC for 10.0.2
    
    * Fix an issue with search/filtering not updating
    
    Searching was not properly showing the overlay, this restores the
    previous behaviour.
    
    * Fix an issue with missing stack counts
    
    This was caused during my attempt to clean up the code a bit, but
    fixes the remaining uses of the stackCount.
