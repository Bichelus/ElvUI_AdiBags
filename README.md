# ElvUI AdiBags
This is a modified version of AdiBags, which will skin it, so it looks like ElvUI again!

This skin is nearly perfect, there are still some small issues i need to address.

Here is a list of known issues:
- [x] Hovering over items in your bag/bank will hide the border color, reopen the bag will display the borders again. **-- Fixed in build 0.03**
- [x] Searching your bag for items dosen't work with the ElvUI skin. **-- Fixed in build 0.02**
- [x] On rare occasions after a loading screen has ended e.g. taking a portal, entering a dungeon etc. the bag can display default AdiBags quality borders, please do a /rl and it should be fixed. **-- This seems fixed in build 0.02+**
- [ ] Switching item positions will make the borders bug out and the switching items will take another items border even tho that item dosent even have a border! This can only be fixed with a /rl.
- [ ] Selling items can make the free space button (if visible) take control of that sold items border, this can only be fixed with a /rl.

Yours sincerely
