# AdiBags
This is a modified version of AdiBags, which will skin it, so it looks like ElvUI again!

This skin is nearly perfect, there are still some small issues i need to address.

Here is a list of known issues:
1. Hovering over items in your bag/bank will hide the border color, reopen bags and will display the borders again.
2. Searching your bag for items dosen't work with the ElvUI skin.
3. On rare occasions after a loading screen has ended e.g. taking a portal, entering a dungeon etc. the bag can display default AdiBags quality borders, please do a /rl and it should be fixed.


Yours sincerely
