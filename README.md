# ElvUI AdiBags
This is a modified version of AdiBags, which will skin it, so it looks like ElvUI again!

This skin is nearly perfect, tho there still is some small issues i need to address.

Here is a list of known issues:
- [x] Hovering over items in your bag/bank will hide the border color, reopen the bag will display the borders again. **-- Fixed in build 0.03**
- [x] Searching your bag for items dosen't work with the ElvUI skin. **-- Fixed in build 0.02**
- [x] On rare occasions after a loading screen has ended e.g. taking a portal, entering a dungeon etc. the bag can display default AdiBags quality borders, please do a /rl and it should be fixed. **-- This seems fixed in build 0.02+**
- [x] Switching item positions from one section to another section, with an item with and without border, will make the item without border take the border color of the item with the border! This can only be fixed with a /rl. **-- Fixed in build 0.07, thanks @Meivyn**
- [x] Rebuying a sold item can make the free space button (if visible) take control of that rebought item border, this can only be fixed with a /rl. **-- Fixed in build 0.04**
- [x] Accepting a quest from a questitem in your bags will make the borders bug out. The same thing happens if you abandon a quest which comes from a questitem in your bags, tho this only happens if your bags are open. This can be fixed by closing and then reopen the bags again! **-- Fixed in build 0.05**

Yours sincerely
