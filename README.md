# AdiBags
This is a modified version of AdiBags to make it look like ElvUI again!

This skin is nearly perfect, there are still some small issues i need to adress.

Here is a list of known issues:
1. Hovering over items in your bag/bank will hide the border color, reopen bags and will display the borders again.
2. Searching your bag for items dosen't work with the ElvUI skin.
3. Sometimes after a loading screen has ended e.g. taking a portal, entering a dungeon etc. the bag can display default AdiBags quality borders, please do a /rl and it should be fixed.

Yours sincerely

Klix
